# File Search

This is a simple Tkinter script designed to search a number of files for a specified string. Note that this currently only works with basic text files.

## Instructions

Simply run the script through a terminal/command window to open the form

1. Select a directory
2. Enter a search string
3. Select whether to ignore case or not, and click `Go`
4. Output will appear in the list box, and will also be saved to a CSV

## What I learned completing this project

I learned the basics of Python's Tkinter and event driven programming. I also understand a little bit more about handline multiple files.

## Future Changes

Here are some changes I may make in the future

* Use an on object orientated (OOP) approach
* Update the script to handles multiple types of files
* Rearrange widgets to update the overall design
* Allow the ability to use regular expression when searching
* More options, like specifying whether you would like a csv copy of the output, where this should be saved, etc
* Use `pyinstaller` to conver this to a desktop app

Have a great day!
